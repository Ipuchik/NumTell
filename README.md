This was the first project I decided to take on after learning the basics of python.

This project might not seem complex but sometimes we need to remember that it all started of simple.

I took on the project because I noticed in my country (Nigeria) the first 3 or 4 digits of a phone number show what type of sim the number belongs to, so I decided to build this to assists banks or recharge card sellers to automatically detect what sim it is without having to ask customers.

It required a lot of research and patience.

Please feel free to go through and implement if relevant to you.
